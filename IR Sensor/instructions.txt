In this we are going to count the number of objects using IR Sensor

Step 1:- Connect the LED's positive terminal with GPIO pin number 40 (Use a resistor to limit the current and to save your board from being damaged).

Step 2:- Connect the LED's negative terminal with the ground (GND) pin.

Step 3:- Give power to IR Sensor from Raspberry Pi Board's Vcc pin and connect the ground from GND pin

Step 4:- Connect the input pin of IR Sensor to pin number 5 (Declare it as input pin in the program)

Step 5:- Run the program
